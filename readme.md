# Demo 4
Congrats, you have made it so far. Now it is ready to have some real fun :). During this demo we will try to implement some basic storage logic for a Media library that we can use to store whatever we want. In this demo we will have classes for books, movies and music. **Please note: we do not endorce piracy, so this is for media you own(maybe)**

We are going to focus on the behind the scene stuff, this means that it will be a lot of non gui elements. 

**This is under GPL lisence, this means that you can do whatever you want with this repo as long as you dont profit off of it**
