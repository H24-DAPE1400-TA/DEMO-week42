# Demo 4
Congrats, you have made it so far. Now it is ready to have some real fun :). During this demo we will try to implement some basic storage logic for a Media library that we can use to store whatever we want. In this demo we will have classes for books, movies and music. **Please note: we do not endorce piracy, so this is for media you own(maybe)**

We are going to focus on the behind the scene stuff, this means that it will be a lot of non gui elements. 

**This is under GPL lisence, this means that you can do whatever you want with this repo as long as you dont profit off of it**

## Structure:  

In this demo there are two folders we will code in: 

### Models folder: 
In this folder is where we see the different java classes for the objects that are inside our music library. These tree classes will act as a "model" for the objects we are using. If we want to implement a database(We will not do this in this course), we can use this model to base our database. 

### Logic folder
This is where we will do all of our coding logic, and will be where our main code part will be. There is an interface containing all the different function inside of it, and will bully us whenever we forget to code something. If you are familiar with the MVC structure, think of it as a combined Repository and Controller folder.  

## In this  demo we will
- Implement a basic media library with no actual media with the things we have already learned during the span of this course
  - populate lists in different ways
  - put items in the list
  - delete lists
- Touch within the subjects
  - Classes and objects
  - arrays and use of other data structures such as lists(arraylist)
    - Demostrate basic use of Java's build in _collection_ class
  - (Extend a bit of what y'all havent touched yet) Interfaces
